# Golden Path - Node.js
Inspired by Spotify's [Golden Path](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/) concept.

The purpose is:

"The Golden Path is the opinionated and supported path to build your system and the Golden Path tutorial walks you through this path"
